## Logos & Nous

In ancient Greek philosophy, "Logos" and "Nous" are two important concepts.

"Logos" originally referred to speech, representing the normativity and certainty of reason, and is the linguistic spirit in Western philosophy.
Logos is intangible and formless; we cannot perceive it with our senses, but we can grasp it with our minds and describe it with language.
The ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus was the first to introduce Logos into philosophy to explain the regularity of changes in all things.
Later, the meaning of Logos continued to evolve, becoming the "doctrine of Logos."

"Nous," also known as mind or intellect, was the first concept to represent independent, pure spirituality, first proposed by Anaxagoras.
Anaxagoras regarded Nous as an independent being, believing it was no longer merely an organ of thought or a certain cognitive ability, but rather a spiritual origin similar to reason.
Subsequently, Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, and the Stoic school developed the concept of Nous, attributing different meanings to it.

Logos and Nous are recognized as concepts that run through the history of Western philosophy, representing the principles of objective passivity and subjective activity, respectively.

In ancient Greek philosophy, Logos and Nous are two very important concepts, especially central in the philosophical systems of early thinkers like Heraclitus, the Stoics, as well as Plato and Aristotle.
